Kalin Project
=============

This [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) project aims to ETL (extract,
transform and load) spatiotemporal data of human mobility for further
analysis.

Beyond the preprocessing jobs, Kalin also introduces a
`stlab` package to facilitate spatotemporal data analysis with Spark RDD.
